need to understand the customer, anticipate his needs, and provide proactive assistance.
Excellent. Next question: **Can you describe a time when you had to handle a difficult customer? What did you do to resolve the situation?**
once a difficult customer was getting on my nerves, then I asked the reason and support more good service
Great approach. Now, let’s move into a realistic scenario: **Imagine a guest complains about their meal being cold while you’re managing a busy section. What’s your immediate action?**
Ask for understanding and reheat the food.
Good. Now, a follow-up question: **If reheating the food isn’t enough for the guest, what steps would you take next to ensure satisfaction?**
I would serve additional some food
Let's proceed with the interview.
